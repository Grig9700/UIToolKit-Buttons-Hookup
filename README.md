Excited about incorporating the new UIToolKit into your project? Great! Keep reading to learn more. If not, well, the choice is yours on how to spend your time.

Are you knee-deep in UI prototyping, constantly tweaking, adding, and removing buttons, while growing increasingly fatigued from the repetitive code modifications or pestering your coder for updates? Fear not!

Introducing our new, user-friendly script that empowers you to effortlessly hook up your buttons without touching a single line of code! Simply drop the script into your scene, add an element to the list, input the button name, and link it to the desired function. It's as intuitive as the old Canvas button system.

Remember to consult with your 'doctor'—ahem, coder—to determine if Button-Hookup is the right prototyping solution for your needs. Please note that Button-Hookup is intended for prototyping purposes only and not for final releases.

Using Button-Hookup may result in unexpected side effects, including peculiar romantic sentiments towards your buttons and eerie whispers urging you to keep pushing them.
