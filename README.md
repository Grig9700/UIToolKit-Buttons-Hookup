Are you wanting to use the new UIToolKit for your project? Nice, then keep reading, if not, well... you decide what you want to do with your time.

Are you in the middle of prototyping your UI, constantly changing, adding, removing buttons and growing increasingly tired of modifying the code/bugging your coder to implement the new button each time a change happens? Well, worry not! 
With this new handy dandy script, you can hook up your buttons yourself without a single line of code! 
All you need to do is plop the script in the scene, add an element to the list, write in the button name and then link it to the function you want it to trigger! Just like in the old Canvas button system.

Remember to talk to your doctor- I mean coder- if Button-Hookup is an appropriate prototyping solution for you~
Button-Hookup is not intended for final releases.
Side effects of using Button-Hookup may include strange romantic feelings of attraction to your buttons and eldritch whispering asking you to keep pushing the buttons.
